% The Grouped Mixtures Clustering (GMC) clustering algorithm.
%  This function uses the Grouped Mixtures Clustering model [1] to cluster
%  multiple datasets simultaneously with cluster sharing between datasets. It
%  uses a Generalised Dirichlet prior over the group mixture weights, and a 
%  Gaussian-Wishart prior over the cluster parameters. This algorithm is similar
%  to a one-level Hierarchical Dirichlet process with Gaussian observations.
%
%  [qZ, weights, means, covariances] = learnGMC (X, options)
%
% Arguments:
%  - X, {Jx[NxD]} cell array of observation matrices (one cell for each group)
%  - options, structure with members (all are optional):
%     + prior, [double] prior cluster value (1 default)
%     + verbose, [bool] verbose output flag (false default)
%     + sparse, [bool] do fast but approximate sparse VB updates (false default)
%     + threads, [unsigned int] number of threads to use (automatic default)
%
% Returns
%  - qZ, {Jx[NxK]} cell array of assignment probablities
%  - weights, {Jx[1xK]} Group mixture weights
%  - means, {Kx[1xD]} Gaussian mixture means
%  - covariances, {Kx[DxD]} Gaussian mixture covariances
