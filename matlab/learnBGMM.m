% The Bayseian Gaussian Mixture Model (BGMM) clustering algorithm.
%  This function uses Bayesian Gaussian Mixture model [2] to cluster data. It is
%  very similar to a Variational Dirichlet Process [1], but uses a Dirichlet
%  prior over the model weights.
%
%  [qZ, weights, means, covariances] = learnBGMM (X, options)
%
% Arguments:
%  - X, [NxD] observation matrix
%  - options, structure with members (all are optional):
%     + prior, [double] prior cluster value (1 default)
%     + verbose, [bool] verbose output flag (false default)
%     + threads, [unsigned int] number of threads to use (automatic default)
%
% Returns
%  - qZ, [NxK] assignment probablities
%  - weights, [1xK] Gaussian mixture weights
%  - means, {Kx[1xD]} Gaussian mixture means
%  - covariances, {Kx[DxD]} Gaussian mixture covariances
